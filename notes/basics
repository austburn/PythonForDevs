- print()
    - a statement, not a function
    - Python2 uses the space as a separator (commas are replaced with spaces)
    - Python3 allows you to specify a separator that the comma will use
- None type
    - There is only ever one None object in Python - initialized at the beginning of execution
- Identifiers and Types
    - Weak data typing - Duck Typing
        - Think Java - and integer is an integer from now till the end of time (must cast)
        - "If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, it's a duck"
    - No size or precision for numbers
    - Integers are essentially unlimited in size
    - Floats are all double precision

        - same result in python2
        - 7//3 = 2.333, 7/3 = 2 in python3
        - 7.0//3.0 = 2.333, 7.0/3.0 = 2 in python 2
    - ** - exponentiation
